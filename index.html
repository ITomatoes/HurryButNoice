  Functional Literacy Program;
  Every child is unique, and they all learn differently, hence “One Size Fits All” philosophy doesn't apply to learning. In today's world, the skills that are essential to do well and help in problem solving, decision making, and innovation are called 21st Century Skills. These skills are broadly categorised into four areas: Critical thinking, Creativity, Communication, and Collaboration.
  
  Using Project and Design based learning approach and STREAM (Science, Technology, Research, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) framework, KNMS creates an environment for your child to learn and develop these 21st Century Skills. KNMS weaves this creative education program as an interdisciplinary and experiential learning approach to teach design and creative thinking as a Subject.
   MATHEMATICS PROGRAM;
  At KNMS, the unique approach ensures that each student loves Math by finding solutions and relating Math problems with their lives. With this curriculum the children move from real life examples to representative pictures to abstract symbols. This helps them develop deeper understanding of MATHS concepts and lifelong learning. It also builds advanced skills in arithmetic operations and a solid foundation in Maths.
